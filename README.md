# AutomationConsole
Super basic bones of a web automation console app
Uses puppeteer and chrome to do things. As is just logs in to a designated site by inputting creds to fields located by css selectors.
Pulled out of an app that tied in Abot web crawler to crawl pages behind a login and run ADA metric tool.
